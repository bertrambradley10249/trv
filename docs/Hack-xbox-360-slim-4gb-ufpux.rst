I just acquired an xbox 4gb slim and looking to hack it to play games from an external hard disk without dvd. Any ideas where i can do it? I just got myself a 4GB slim off eBay. It's not here yet, but I know it has the Metro Dash, and the latest it could have been updated is. Want to sell my xbox slim 4gb jtag mod console. The console is modded with jtag chip which means u can play any games from your hdd.
